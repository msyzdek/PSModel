# Requirements Document: Holder Management Enhancements

## Introduction

This spec contains future enhancements to the holder management system. These features build upon the core holder management functionality (Requirements 1-7) and provide additional capabilities for search, validation, analytics, and data migration.

These requirements are planned for future implementation after the core holder management system is complete.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Quick Period Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to quickly create a new period by copying the previous month's data, so that I can minimize repetitive data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new period THEN the system SHALL offer a "Copy from Previous" button
2. WHEN copying from previous THEN the system SHALL copy all holder names, shares, and personal charges
3. WHEN copying from previous THEN the system SHALL allow bulk editing before saving
4. WHEN no previous period exists THEN the system SHALL use default holder values
5. WHEN creating multiple future periods THEN the system SHALL allow batch creation with copied data

### Requirement 2: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user with existing periods, I want the new holder system to work with my historical data, so that I don't lose any information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system upgrades THEN it SHALL migrate existing holder names to the master list
2. WHEN viewing old periods THEN the system SHALL display holder information correctly
3. WHEN creating new periods THEN the system SHALL use the new holder management system
4. IF duplicate holder names exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into single master records
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL preserve all historical calculations and carry-forwards

### Requirement 3: Holder Search and Filter

**User Story:** As a user with many holders, I want to search and filter the holder list, so that I can quickly find specific holders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the holder list THEN the system SHALL provide a search box
2. WHEN typing in search THEN the system SHALL filter holders by name in real-time
3. WHEN filtering by status THEN the system SHALL show only active or inactive holders
4. WHEN sorting the list THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by name or participation count
5. WHEN no results match THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message

### Requirement 4: Holder Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to validate holder data, so that I can avoid errors and inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a holder THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate names
2. WHEN entering holder name THEN the system SHALL require non-empty names
3. WHEN setting default shares THEN the system SHALL require positive integer values
4. WHEN creating a period THEN the system SHALL require at least one holder to be selected
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Holder Analytics

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see holder participation history, so that I can understand holder involvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a holder THEN the system SHALL show total periods participated
2. WHEN viewing a holder THEN the system SHALL show date range of participation
3. WHEN viewing a holder THEN the system SHALL show total payouts received
4. WHEN viewing a holder THEN the system SHALL show average shares held
5. WHEN viewing a holder THEN the system SHALL provide a link to view all their periods
